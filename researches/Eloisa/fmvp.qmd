## INTRODUCTION

### Background of the Study

The fluctuation of vegetable prices is a global concern in both developed and emerging economies. The demand for vegetables as a primary source of essential nutrients and dietary variety has increased concomitantly with urbanization and global population growth. Consequently, the dynamics of vegetable pricing have grown more intricate and significant, having an effect not just on consumer choices but also on food security, economic stability, and agricultural practices. Understanding the factors driving these price fluctuations is paramount for policymakers, farmers, consumers, and the broader food industry [@chen18].

Vegetables are a major life necessity for urban and rural residents, and the vegetable market massively supports rural economic development. Fluctuations in vegetable prices affect farmers' income, quality of life, and decision-making regarding vegetable planting. Therefore, issues regarding maintaining price stability have long been focused on government policies. In recent years, the price of vegetables has exhibited dramatic and frequent volatility, which caused a series of negative effects on stakeholders in the supply-chain, e.g., farmers, logistics, wholesale, retail, and consumers. In view of the above adverse effects on stakeholders, it is of crucial importance to filter out key factors that relate to price fluctuations, targeting effective monitoring of real-time abnormal fluctuations [@chen18].

Price fluctuation is a complex issue with far-reaching consequences, especially for vulnerable populations. While higher prices may appear beneficial for farmers, the inherent volatility poses significant risks, potentially leading to substantial losses for agricultural stakeholders. Often attributed to imbalances in market fundamentals, where demand surpasses supply, this phenomenon has a profound impact on small-scale farmers [@mchopa14].

Prices for vegetables fluctuate frequently, harming the financial interests of farmers, business owners, and consumers. Vegetable market prices are influenced by market supply and demand mechanisms, as well as a variety of internal and external influences. Weather fluctuations are one of these aspects, and they can have varied degrees of impact on the entire process of planting, harvesting, transporting, and selling vegetables. The supply chain for vegetables in China is more vulnerable to weather extremes due to the spatial concentration of vegetable production and the dispersed consumer base, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and abnormally large-scale fluctuations in vegetable prices that have an impact on people's livelihoods [@yang22].

According to @fao, agricultural products account for a large proportion of the market as a necessity for daily consumption, and their prices play a critical part in consumer spending and agricultural household income. The supply and demand in a given year determine the prices of agricultural products. While an under supply of agricultural items raises prices and burdens consumers, an oversupply of agricultural products causes vegetable prices to increase and causes financial losses to farming households.

Moreover, vegetable prices have an impact on farmers' income, standard of living, and vegetable producing choices. This is due to the cyclical and seasonal swings that affect vegetable prices; the price trend would alter based on the season, demand, and other factors. Therefore, concerns about price stability have typically focused on government initiatives. Vegetable prices have varied sharply and frequently recently, having a variety of negative effects on supply-chain participants like farmers, transportation, wholesale, retail, and customers [@chen18].

Policy uncertainty may rise as a result of fluctuating commodity prices [@qiao23]. Distributors may find it challenging to plan purchases, inventory control, and pricing strategies due to this unpredictability. Distributors who are unable to anticipate price fluctuations may face financial losses if they buy vegetables at a high price and then the price drops before they can sell them. According to Yiyang et al., smallholder farmers are more vulnerable to risk when prices fluctuate. This is due to the fact that smallholder farmers frequently have little resources and are unable to absorb the potential financial losses caused by changes in prices. These price-induced risks could have an impact on distributors who depend on smallholder farmers for their supplies because they can result in supply disruptions and higher sourcing expenses.

In the Philippines, vegetables price height has been a major problem for past years. Consumers were complaining of higher food prices, reflected not only in vegetables but in poultry and pork meat as well, and selected fish variants. Some prices have gone up by as much as 66 percent from last month alone. The Department of Agriculture officials have blamed the higher prices on numerous factors such as the ongoing pandemic, the devastating typhoons that destroyed crops, and the unwillingness of poultry and hog raisers to farm a new following the glut and the spread of the African swine fever, respectively.

As stated by @vibas19, Agricultural commodities significantly impact a country's export earnings and economic performance. Price fluctuations affect farmers, consumers, and public agencies. The Department of Agriculture in the Philippines recognizes that local market-driven commodity pricing, notably for fruits and vegetables, have prompted government action.

Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal (NVAT) General Manager Gilbert Cumila said, vegetable prices in the Philippines continue to rise as demand exceeds supply. Wholesale prices of vegetables increases due to the demand of people. This significantly affect the way consumers purchase vegetables to sustain their necessities.

The purpose of the study is to fully comprehend the factors affecting changes in vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya. The study intends to offer significant insights and suggestions for farmers, consumers, and distributors by concentrating on forecasting the monthly vegetable prices. These stakeholders should be more prepared to react to monthly changes in vegetable prices when making decisions as a result of this research.

### Statement of the Problem

In response to the challenge of volatile vegetable prices faced by local farmers, distributors, and consumers, the researchers provided forecasts of monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya. This effort aimed to assist them in making informed decisions regarding agricultural production, distribution, and vegetable purchases.

To do this, the researchers used five years of available time series data on vegetable prices from the Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal (NVAT) to come up with models that forecast monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya. First, the researchers described the monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya. Next, they fitted models to the data using automatic methods. The researchers then determined which automatic method had the best forecast performance for each vegetable and used these methods to forecast monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya.

### Objectives of the Study

### Scope and Delimitation of the Study

The study focused on forecasting the monthly prices of vegetables in NVAT, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya. The researchers used time series of vegetable prices for five years available from NVAT. From this data, monthly time series of prices for each vegetable were described. ARIMA, SARIMA, and ETS models were then fitted to the data using automatic algorithms and time series cross-validation to generate optimal models for each vegetable. Comparison of computed point forecast measures for the generated models determined the best automatic method to use in forecasting monthly prices for each vegetable. A portmanteau test of residuals was used to assess the performance of the models generated by the best automatic method to forecast monthly prices for each vegetable.

The researchers performed log transformations with the data to make sure that forecasts stay positive. Model specifications were not set either, as this process was performed automatically using default settings. All computations and visualizations were performed in the R programming language [@r]. Moreover, external variables impacting vegetable prices were not investigated nor incorporated in the modeling process.

### Conceptual Framework

The research paradigm as shown in @fig-rp guided the researchers in conducting the study. It consists of input, process, and output. The input is the available time series of vegetable prices from NVAT. The outputs are ARIMA, SARIMA, and ETS models generated by the best automatic method for each vegetable, along with their corresponding monthly forecasts. Under process, time series analysis was carried out using automatic algorithms in time series cross-validation to generate different optimal ARIMA, SARIMA, and ETS models for each vegetable. From this, the best automatic method for each vegetable was determined by comparing the point forecast accuracy measures of the models generated. Also, portmanteau test of residuals was performed to describe the performance of the final model for each vegetable.

## REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

### Vegetable Prices

Vegetables have the greatest supply and price volatility of any agricultural item. Vegetables are difficult to keep in a consistent supply and price because they are grown outside and their yields vary greatly depending on the weather. As a result, vegetables have a substantial economic impact. Despite the government's best efforts, recurring weather shifts have generated instability in vegetable supply and price swings in recent years [@illankoon2020].

Prices for vegetables fluctuate frequently, harming the financial interests of farmers, business owners, and consumers. Vegetable market prices are influenced by market supply and demand mechanisms, as well as a variety of internal and external influences. Weather fluctuations are one of these aspects, and they can have varied degrees of impact on the entire process of planting, harvesting, transporting, and selling vegetables. The supply chain for vegetables in China is more vulnerable to weather extremes due to the spatial concentration of vegetable production and the dispersed consumer base, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand and abnormally large-scale fluctuations in vegetable prices that have an impact on people's livelihoods [@yang22].

Moreover, vegetable prices have an impact on farmers' income, standard of living, and vegetable producing choices. This is due to the cyclical and seasonal swings that affect vegetable prices; the price trend will alter based on the season, demand, and other factors. Therefore, concerns about price stability have typically focused on government initiatives. Vegetable prices have varied sharply and frequently recently, having a variety of negative effects on supply-chain participants like farmers, transportation, wholesale, retail, and customers [@chen18].

The quality of life of residents will be directly impacted by frequent increases in vegetable market prices, which will also bury hidden dangers for the fall in vegetable prices in the subsequent round of prices. In contrast, the continued decline in vegetable market prices results in prices that are too low and negatively impact the vital interests and production enthusiasm of vegetable farmers, leaving the supply of vegetables poorly protected and causing the subsequent round of skyrocketing prices. Regional vegetable price fluctuations have a significant negative impact on farmers and consumers, which has an impact on the macroeconomic stability and significantly lowers the degree of regional social welfare [@gan20].

Vegetables are highly perishable products [@desalegn21]. This implies that a variety of factors, including supply and demand, weather, and storage availability, might have a significant impact on their pricing. Distributors may become uneasy as a result of these developments, which will make it challenging for them to project earnings and run their businesses efficiently. According to the study, the vegetable value chain commonly involves middlemen. When veggies are plentiful, these intermediaries usually take advantage of price volatility by buying them at a discount from growers and reselling them to clients at a premium when they are in short supply. Having to outbid middlemen for supplies may result in lower profit margins for distributors. As mentioned in the introduction of the study of Desalegn, smallholder farmers in rural areas usually lack access to functioning market information. They consequently struggle to anticipate price changes and effectively haggle for their produce. Distributors who depend on these farmers for their goods are indirectly impacted by this ignorance. It was also emphasized in the study of Desalegn that the perishable nature of vegetables is another issue. Distributors could therefore suffer since, when the market gets saturated, they won't be able to keep excess inventory on hand and would have to sell produce at a loss.

In the Philippines, sustainable soil nutrient-enhancing strategies involve the wise use and management of inorganic and organic nutrient sources in ecologically sound production systems [@janssen93]. The primary goal of integrated nutrient management (INM) is to combine old and new methods of nutrient management into ecologically sound and economically viable farming systems that utilize available organic and inorganic sources of nutrients in a judicious and efficient way. Integrated nutrient management optimizes all aspects of nutrient cycling. It attempts to achieve tight nutrient cycling with synchrony between nutrient demand by the crop and nutrient release in the soil, while minimizing losses through leaching, runoff, volatilization and immobilization. Providing higher economic returns per unit area and developing new export markets for high value crops in the Philippines has been identified as a priority by the Philippine Government and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) as means of increasing economic growth and improving the standard of living of people living in rural areas. Regions VIII (Leyte), X (Northern Mindanao/Cagayan de Oro) and XI (Southern Mindanao/ Davao) have significant potential for expanding vegetable production. Moreover, they are seen as strategically important to the Australian Government, whereby efforts to improve the livelihoods of the populations in these areas could contribute to improving geo-political stability in the region [@tulin19].

Benguet, a mountainous province in the northern Philippines, trucks down at least 1,500 metric tons of semi-temperate vegetables every day to depots called bagsakan in Manila, the nation's capital. When demand spikes around holidays like Christmas and Easter, the volume of deliveries can triple. Eighty percent of the nation's need for semi-temperate vegetables like potatoes, cabbage, radish, chayote, carrot, lettuce, and broccoli is met by crops that are shipped from Manila throughout the archipelago. Situated atop the Cordillera mountain range, the high altitude of Benguet province is conducive to the production of these kinds of crops, which are also known as highland vegetables. With a minimum 1.1 million metric tons produced annually. However, as farmers use chemical-heavy fertilizers to boost yields, fifty years of toiling the land to feed millions across the country is causing the forest cover to slowly disappear and the soil to deteriorate. In addition to causing fluctuating vegetable prices and oversupply --- which frequently results in spoilage and losses for farmers --- the region's growing number of farmers and farmland, all of which are planting upland vegetables.

Pricing Theory and Law of Supply and Demand is used to interpret the gathered statistical data from previous studies in this systematic review of economics literature in the Philippines. It provides explanation on the responsiveness of seaweed farmers in the Philippines to the price changes in relation to the supply and demand that is changing from time to time. The strong demand of seaweed drives the market prices, and this may drive seaweed farmers to increase the seaweed production but when the price are low seaweed farmers have the tendency to leave their farms resulting in a low production of seaweed and in effect a decrease in seaweed supply. This problem may be enlightened using the law of supply and demand wherein when the demand is high --- the price is high, and the supply is low. On the other hand, if the demand is low --- the price is low, and the supply is high. As a result, the seaweed farmers are not responsive to price changes in the short-run and in the long-run [@guerrero22].

### Forecasting Vegetable Prices

Accurate agricultural price forecasting is critical to achieving sustainable and healthy agricultural development, and it is a hot research area in the agricultural industry. It explores traditional forecasting procedures, intelligent forecasting methods, and combination model forecasting methods, as well as the obstacles found in the current research landscape of agricultural commodity price prediction [@sun23].

Farming is first and foremost defined by family work, which is limited by the availability of land, water, and capital resources. Choosing which agricultural items to produce must be made by farmers, however there are oftentimes not enough possibilities to enable the best farming decisions. Farmers must choose which vegetables will bring in the highest prices at harvest. The aforementioned issue was fixed by estimating pricing based on weather conditions using machine learning technologies. The hopeful results of the Prediction model are what have made Machine Learning so well-liked. This paper explores the use of multiple regression models to forecast vegetable prices, and its applicability has also been taken into account. In order to plan for their forthcoming crop and prevent hyperinflation, farmers benefit from being able to estimate vegetable prices [@kakulapati22].

Forecasting vegetable prices is critical in the agricultural industry for making sound judgments. This forecasting task is quite difficult. Because neural networks are self-adaptive, have a high learning capacity, and are adaptable, they are used to tackle a wide range of difficult tasks. This model forecasts the price of vegetables for the next day based on the previous price of time series data. This research compares and contrasts three machine learning algorithms: radial basis function, back propagation neural network, and genetically based neural network. The models are assessed, and the accuracy percentages show that the genetically based neural network outperforms propagation neural networks and radial basis functions in terms of vegetable price prediction accuracy [@subhasree16].

The vegetable industry is crucial, particularly in terms of supplying an abundance of fresh agricultural products. For the agriculture sector to make wise decisions, vegetable price forecasting is essential. The challenges that Malaysian farmers face is not just related to aging, but also to their ability to compete in a country where consumers prioritize fresh produce and fruits from hypermarkets and wholesale markets over supermarkets. This review article aids in identifying the present issues facing Malaysia's agriculture industry and examines the connection between agriculture and e-commerce. The growth of e-agriculture has been noted by researchers recently, and the authors discovered that an agricultural e-commerce platform equipped with a price forecasting model could be useful in resolving a current national issue. This study examines the global agricultural e-commerce platforms currently in use and makes an attempt to compare it with the domestic market. Following the completion of the reviews, the authors propose building a time analysis model in a hybrid approach for vegetable price forecasting in an agricultural e-commerce platform. This model can be utilized by the government to inform policy decisions [@nath2023].

In the Philippines, box-Jenkins technique and the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model were used to forecast onion production. Using historical data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the ARMA (4,2) model was applied to construct an optimal forecasting solution. The model passed diagnostic tests with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10.406%. The predicted yields for each quarter were highlighted, as were projections for onion output in 2023 and 2024. An examination of historical data indicated that weather trends, consumer demand, agricultural techniques, and imports and exports all contribute to periodic variations in onion supply. The study's findings highlight the significance of employing exact forecasting models when deciding how to distribute resources, establish pricing, and place products on the market [@capiral23].

Commodity prices have an impact on both producers and consumers; therefore, estimating their future value is important for making decisions down the road. The purpose of this study is to assist policymakers in developing guidelines that will benefit producers and consumers of agricultural products such as sitao, whole chicken, eggplant, tomato, pork ham, and pork liempo. The chosen commodities' data behavior for the years 2013--2022 was examined by the researchers, and they all showed an upward trend with some fluctuations. Numerous factors, including seasonality of production, volume surplus, pest and disease, typhoon destruction, and importation, are found to be linked to these fluctuations. The researcher used the ARIMA technique to forecast the price of this agricultural produce after analyzing the price behavior [@zhang20].

Crop climate calendars enhance traditional crop calendars by providing phenological states, cultivation techniques, and weather and climatic requirements that all crops must meet during a cropping season, as well as planting and harvest timings. The case for capturing this data in Benguet is compelling: the mountainous province benefits from the growth of high-value crops like carrots, cabbage, and potatoes despite weather phenomena such as hail, frost, and various microclimates. The researchers conducted focus groups with municipal agriculturalists and farmer leaders in Atok, Benguet, to better understand their experiences and build their crop climate calendar. The calendars developed during this experiment could provide a solid foundation for investigating the area's climate-sensitive agricultural methods [@domingo20].

### Synthesis

Vegetable prices are influenced by various factors, both internationally and within specific countries like the Philippines. Internationally, studies have shown that vegetables have a high supply and price volatility due to their dependence on weather conditions. Weather fluctuations can lead to inconsistent vegetable supply and large-scale price fluctuations, impacting farmers, business owners, and consumers [@illankoon2020; @yang22]. This instability in prices affects farmers' income, standard of living, and their choices in vegetable production [@chen18].

In the Philippines, the pricing of vegetables is also influenced by factors such as market supply and demand, weather conditions, and storage availability. Distributors and middlemen play a role in price volatility, taking advantage of fluctuations to buy vegetables at a discount and resell them at a higher price when supply is low [@desalegn21]. Smallholder farmers in rural areas often lack access to market information, making it difficult for them to anticipate price changes and negotiate effectively, indirectly impacting distributors who rely on their produce. Additionally, the perishable nature of vegetables poses a challenge for distributors who may suffer losses when market saturation occurs and excess inventory cannot be stored.

Accurate forecasting of vegetable prices is crucial for sustainable agricultural development. Machine learning technologies and regression models have been used to forecast vegetable prices based on factors such as weather conditions, previous price data, and market trends [@kakulapati22; @subhasree16]. In the Philippines, forecasting models have been applied to predict the production and prices of specific vegetables like onions, using historical data and considering factors such as weather trends, consumer demand, and agricultural techniques [@capiral23].

In conclusion, vegetable prices are influenced by various factors internationally and within specific countries like the Philippines. Factors such as weather fluctuations, market supply and demand, and the role of distributors and middlemen contribute to price volatility. Accurate forecasting of vegetable prices using machine learning and regression models can help farmers and policymakers make informed decisions. Understanding and addressing these factors are crucial for achieving sustainable agricultural development and improving the livelihoods of farmers and consumers.

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Research Design

The research is purely quantitative in nature. Specifically, the researchers employed comparative time series forecasting [@hyndman21]. In this study, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models were compared to determine the best model to forecast monthly prices for each vegetable.

### Locale of the Study

The study was conducted in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya. Specifically, the data for this study was collected from the Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal (NVAT), which is located in Bambang. Bambang is the next town south of Bayombong --- the capital town of the province of Nueva Vizcaya. Please see @fig-bambang below.

![Map of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambang,\_Nueva_Vizcaya#/media/File:Ph_locator_nueva_vizcaya_bambang.png)](pictures/bambang.png){#fig-bambang fig-align="center"}

<br>

### Source and Subject of the Study

The primary source of data for the research is the NVAT. Six years and two months of available time series of vegetable prices from the NVAT were used to come up with forecasts of monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya.

### Data Gathering Procedure

The researchers inquired about the background and data policy of NVAT by visiting its office. Additionally, letters requesting permission to gather data for the research were written to the NVSU President, NVAT General Manager, and the Municipal Mayor of Bambang (refer to Appendix A, B, and C, respectively). Subsequently, the researchers were able to collect time series of vegetable prices for six years and 2 months. Throughout the data collection process, strict adherence to ethical considerations, including data confidentiality and approval from appropriate authorities, were maintained.

### Data Analysis and Treatment of Data

In forecasting monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya, the researchers followed the process illustrated in @fig-workflow. It is an adapted representation of the workflow introduced by @hyndman21.

```{r}
#| label: diagram-workflow
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 6

workflow <- DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

vtree::grVizToPNG(workflow, filename = "pictures/workflow.png", width = 600)
```

![Data Treatment and Analysis Workflow](pictures/workflow.png){#fig-workflow fig-align="center" width="600"}

<br>

The tidy part involves preparing the raw data in the correct format. This includes loading the raw data into R and identifying and resolving missing values to create a tidy time series data for monthly vegetable prices. The researchers utilized the `tsibble` and `tidyverse` packages for this task [@wickham19; @wang20].

Subsequently, the researchers visualized the monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya. The trend and seasonal components of the data were also visualized using the seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) method developed by @cleveland90. These visualizations were integral in describing the data.

Next, automatic algorithms introduced by @hyndman21 were used to estimate or fit optimal ARIMA and ETS models to the data. The researchers would implement these algorithms in R using the `fable` package [@fable].

Moreover, time series cross-validation was used to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the automatic ARIMA method and the automatic ETS method [@hyndman21]. Point forecast accuracy measures such as the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute squared error (MASE) were computed from the generated models and then compared to determine the best method to be used in forecasting monthly vegetable prices. The method with lower point forecast accuracy measures was selected as the best method for each vegetable.

Then, the best method for each vegetable was used to generate models to forecast monthly vegetable prices in Nueva Vizcaya.

Finally, a portmanteau test in the form of the Ljung-Box test was computed for the models used to forecast monthly vegetable prices. This allowed the researchers to describe the performance of these models. Computed p-values greater than .05 confirm that the residuals are similar to white noise. Otherwise, the residuals still have some remaining autocorrelation that is not accounted for in the model [@hyndman21].

The broccoli time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[1, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[1, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[1, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[1, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[1, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[1, 5]`.

The trend strength suggests a stable increase or decrease in prices over time, which may reflect broader economic conditions affecting both farmers and consumers. Moreover, results suggest that supply of broccoli is scarce in September. Thus the peak in price due to high demand. Also, results suggest that supply is abundant in January. Thus the trough in price due to low demand.

For farmers, understanding these seasonal dynamics is crucial for optimizing production and marketing strategies. By aligning planting schedules with peak demand periods, they can maximize profits and reduce the risk of oversupply, which often leads to lower prices. Conversely, during low-demand months, farmers can plan for reduced production or explore alternative crops to mitigate financial losses.

Consumers also benefit from this knowledge by timing their purchases to coincide during the trough period, when prices are generally lower. This strategic buying behavior not only helps consumers save money but also encourages a more efficient market where supply and demand are better balanced. 

Awareness of the seasonal peak and trough in broccoli pricing enables both farmers and consumers to make informed decisions, fostering a more resilient agricultural economy.

Broccoli has a moderate trend and a moderate seasonal strength. For farmers, this means that although production and sales volume are increasing over the long run, there are also significant seasonal fluctuations. Since the price of broccoli peaks in September and troughs in January, it may be expected that it is abundant in late summer and early fall, when it can be harvested and sold within a certain period of time. During peak season, farmers may have the product may be rare and more expensive, whereas during trough season, consumers may have easier access to the product and pay less.

The cabbage time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[2, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[2, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[2, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[2, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[2, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[2, 5]`.

The trend for cabbage is weak and the seasonality is considerably weaker. This shows that production is moderate and nearly consistent all year round, with very little indications of the holiday season. Since the price of cabbage is highest in September and lowest in March, it may be purchased at any time of year, though March is likely the best month to buy it because it is more affordable. Farmers can plan their crop production and storage operations to ensure that consumer expectations regarding costs do not significantly change.

The carrot time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[3, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[3, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[3, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[3, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[3, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[3, 5]`.

The trend strength and seasonal strength of the carrot are both medium. Given that it peaks in August and troughs in May suggests that late summer is a great time for carrot production.  Its August peak and May trough indicate that late summer is a favorable period to harvest carrots. Farmers may find it beneficial to focus on harvest and marketing around August to optimize profit, even though consumers may benefit from more favorable pricing and availability in May rather than August.

The cauliflower time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[4, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[4, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[4, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[4, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[4, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[4, 5]`.

Cauliflower has a medium trend and a very seasonal series. This is the best time of year for the farmer to sell cauliflower since there will be a market for it, with peaks in August and troughs in March. During the trough months, consumers can anticipate cheaper costs and better availability, and during the peak, they should anticipate higher prices and less availability.

The celery time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[5, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[5, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[5, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[5, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[5, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[5, 5]`.

Celery has a moderate trend and strong seasonal pattern.  As a result, celery cultivation and sales are seasonal, reaching their peak in September and trough in March. During this time, farmers can plan how to harvest and sell their products when there is most demand. Consumers should anticipate more supply and lower prices in March. 

The chayote (bunga) time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[6, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[6, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[6, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[6, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[6, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[6, 5]`.

The seasonal and trend strength of the chayote (bunga) was well-balanced. Given that it peaks in September and troughs in March suggests that seasonality and the trend were significant contributors to its production. Farmers can so anticipate consistent yield with distinct peaks and troughs, while consumers can make purchases based on seasonal availability.

The cucumber time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[7, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[7, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[7, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[7, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[7, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[7, 5]`.

The seasonal strength of cucumber was a significantly lower compared to its trend strength. The peak in December and the trough in July suggest that there might be an oversupply of cucumbers in the winter. Farmers would have to focus on winter harvests, even though consumers are expected to have better access to and probably purchase at lower prices during this trough season.

The gabi (galyang) time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[8, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[8, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[8, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[8, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[8, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[8, 5]`.

Gabi (Galyang) has the strongest trend with a mild seasonality. There is a strong long-term trend with strong seasonal fluctuation, peaking in September and troughing in February. Farmers should focus a lot of effort on maximizing sales and availability during the peak season. February is anticipated to have the best supply and prices for consumers. 

The pepper (sultan) time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[9, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[9, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[9, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[9, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[9, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[9, 5]`.

The seasonal strength and weak trend of pepper (Sultan) are characterized by September peaks and May troughs. With the peak in September, farmers can aim a higher market that month, but this would indicate minimal effects of trend and seasonality, suggesting rather consistent production. Consumers would make purchases around May for better availability and probably lower prices.

The pepper (taiwan) time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[10, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[10, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[10, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[10, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[10, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[10, 5]`.

The pepper (taiwan) seasonal strength is stronger while the trend strength. Farmers would seek to optimize production and sales throughout the winter months because the peak was in December and the trough was in April. Consumers would find more availability of peppers at a reasonable price in April.

The potato time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[11, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[11, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[11, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[11, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[11, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[11, 5]`.

Potato shows moderate seasonality and a significant trend. The peak is in October and the trough is in May. Consumers should anticipate October prices to be more accommodating than the prices on May, allowing farmers to take advantage of peak seasons to guarantee larger returns.

The wombok time series has a trend strength of `r tbl_stl[12, 2]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[12, 2]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by trend not considering seasonality. On the other hand, it has a seasonal strength of `r tbl_stl[12, 3]`, showing that `r tbl_stl[12, 3]*100`% of the time series is accounted for by seasonality not considering trend. Its peak is in `r tbl_stl[12, 4]` and its trough is in `r tbl_stl[12, 5]`.

Wombok indicates a trend of 0.14 and seasonality of 0.19, the weakest of all. This would indicate that its supply is fairly steady, with just small seasonal fluctuations, with a peak in September and a trough in March. Produce availability and costs should be fairly stable for consumers throughout the year, and farmers can maintain a consistent production schedule.

The vegetable with the strongest trend is gabi (galyang). Meanwhile, the vegetable that has the weakest trend is wombok. The vegetable with the strongest seasonality is cauliflower. Meanwhile, the vegetable with the weakest seasonality is cabbage. Please see Appendix D for the seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS (STL).

These trends and seasonality allow farmers to plan accordingly in production and marketing, while consumers are better placed in making decisions on when to buy vegetables for the best prices and availability.

The automatic ARIMA method proved to be better than the automatic ETS method based on the time series cross-validation performance measures, except for gabi (galyang). The automatic ARIMA method showed higher accuracy on all performance measures for all vegetables except for gabi (galyang). The automatic ETS method also showed higher accuracy on all performance measures for gabi (galyang). Thus, the automatic ARIMA method was used to generate models and forecasts for all the vegetables except for gabi (galyang), for which automatic ETS method was used.

Using the SARIMA model, the forecast is stating that the average price per head of broccoli will hover around the indicated mark and steadily rise starting from January to April of the year 2024. This therefore indicates that cost could be on a rising trend as they were approximated to be; 35.97 for January down to 39.72 in April.

On the other hand, with the increase in uncertainty, the confidence intervals enlarge. January’s 80% confidence interval is equal to 21.38 to 53. The number is 10 before the new month and 46; by the middle of the month, it rises to 12.65 to 79.09. Likewise, the 95% confidence intervals expand with the length of the horizons indicating higher degree of forecast error volatility.

Results show that all the ARIMA models have a large p-value but the ETS model for gabi (galyang) has a p-value less than .05. This shows that the residuals of all the ARIMA models are independently distributed. This indicates that there is no significant autocorrelation in the residuals up to 12 lags. The ARIMA models are a good fit to the data. They can be used in forecasting their corresponding monthly vegetable prices. On the other hand, the ETS model failed the portmanteau test since there is still significant autocorrelation in the residuals up to 12 lags. The model can still be used for forecasting monthly gabi (galyang) prices, but the prediction or confidence intervals may not be accurate due to the correlated residuals.

## SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Summary

The price trends of 12 vegetables from 2018 to 2024 exhibited significant fluctuations over the period. Among the vegetables, pepper (taiwan) has demonstrated the most volatile price behavior, with frequent and substantial price swings. Conversely, potato has shown relatively stable prices throughout the period. Other vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrot, have experienced moderate price fluctuations.

Additionally, chayote (bunga) and gabi (galyang) have exhibited relatively stable price trends, with minimal fluctuations. Celery, cucumber, and wombok have shown moderate price variations, with occasional spikes or dips. Pepper (sultan) has experienced significant price fluctuations, with both upward and downward trends. Finally, cauliflower has demonstrated moderate price volatility, with occasional peaks and troughs.

The vegetable with the strongest trend is gabi (galyang). Meanwhile, the vegetable that has the weakest trend is wombok. The vegetable with the strongest seasonality is cauliflower. Meanwhile, the vegetable with the weakest seasonality is cabbage.

The automatic ARIMA method outperformed the automatic ETS method in time series cross-validation performance measures for all vegetables except gabi (galyang). The automatic ARIMA method showed higher accuracy in all performance measures for all vegetables except gabi (galyang). Thus, the automatic ARIMA method was used to generate models and forecasts for all the vegetables except for gabi (galyang), for which automatic ETS method was used.

SARIMA model forecasts for vegetable prices from January to April 2024 indicate different trends and considerable uncertainty. Broccoli and celery prices will rise steadily; cauliflower and cucumber prices will rise, but at a slower rate. Carrot prices will remain relatively stable with small fluctuations. Chayote and gabi prices will be relatively stable with slight increases. Both pepper (sultan) and pepper (Taiwan) prices are forecast to be volatile; pepper (sultan) will have a strong upturn, while pepper (Taiwan) will turn down. Potato and wombok prices will oscillate with a relatively stable increase. Meanwhile, gabi (galyang) for ETS model, the price will rise steadily.  Most notably, the volatility is high in all forecasts. High volatility is also indicated by the wide confidence interval, which indicates the potential for large price movements.

The Portmanteau test of residuals for ARIMA models revealed that all models have a large p-value, but the ETS model for gabi (galyang) has a p-value less than.05. This indicates that the residuals are independently distributed, with no significant autocorrelation up to 12 lags. The ARIMA models are a good fit for forecasting monthly vegetable prices, while the ETS model failed the test due to significant autocorrelation up to 12 lags. Despite this, the model can still be used for gabi (galyang) price forecasting, but the prediction or confidence intervals may not be accurate due to correlated residuals.

### Conclusion

The results show that gabi (galyang) has the strongest trend, while wombok has the weakest trend, cauliflower shows the strongest seasonality, while cabbage shows the weakest seasonality. Farmers should focus on producing vegetables with strong trends, like gabi (galyang), to benefit on increasing demand. Farmers can also plan their production and marketing strategies according to the trend and seasonality of specific vegetable vegetables. Consumers, and can make good decisions about when to buy vegetables. For example, consumers may expect better availability and lower prices for cauliflower in August, while the highest and lowest prices for cabbage are found in March and September, however. All things considered, farmers can improve their production and sales and increase their earnings by knowing the trends and seasonality of vegetables. This knowledge can also help customers make wiser desicions in buying.

The result shows that Broccoli and celery prices will rise steadily; cauliflower and cucumber prices will rise, but at a slower rate. Carrot prices will remain relatively stable with small fluctuations. Chayote and gabi for ETS model prices will be relatively stable with slight increases. Both pepper (sultan) and pepper (Taiwan) prices are forecast to be volatile; pepper (sultan) will have a strong upturn, while pepper (Taiwan) will turn down. Potato and wombok prices will oscillate with a relatively stable increase. Farmers should focus on vegetables that will be steadily increases like Broccoli, Celery, pepper (taiwan and sultan), but they should also be mindful that the confidence interval as month goes by, the price range increases, indicating that a higher chance of forecast error. Consumers should focus on vegetables that vegetables that will be stable with small fluctuations and slight increases like cauliflower, cucumber, carrots, chayote, and gabi but should also be knowledgeable about the forecast error since the price range as months goes by, the forecast error increases.
	
The ARIMA model proves to be better in all 12 lags in forecasting vegetable prices except for Gabi (galyang) indicating that ARIMA model is  better fit model for forecasting monthly vegetable prices.
